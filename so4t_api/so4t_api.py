        User impersonation:
        - is only available in Stack Overflow Enterprise

        - is turned off by default and requires a support ticket to turn it on

        This can be setup during instantiation of the StackClient via the `key=APIKEY` parameter
        Or it can be manually assigned to an existing StackClient via `client_name.key = APIKEY`

        An account ID of `-1` can be used to impersonate the Community user

    Results in an HTTP 403 status code.

    - The access token is being used to perform a write operation and the token has not been
        write-enabled
    - The access token was created by a user who does not have permissions to perform a given
        operation. Certain API actions require the user to have moderator or administrator

    In the latter case, the `get_myself` endpoint can be used to validate the user's permissions.
    For the `role` field are two different permissions values: 'Registered' and 'Moderator'.
    Registered users have the most basic access and canleverage a subset of the API's full
    capabilities.
